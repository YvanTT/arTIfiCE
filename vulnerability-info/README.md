This folder houses an example on how a program can be ran through CalibriJr. This example doesn't print a message sadly, but it does certainly execute.

# Overview
(This is based on what I have found and is certainly not comprehensive)

CalibriJr can load figures through 8xv files. These 8xv files contain a variable and some special assembly. Every figure will have at least the following assembly at start:
```asm
ld	b,e
ld	h,c
ld	c,d
ld	(hl),l
ld	h,(hl)
inc	b
dec	b
```

I'm not sure what it does, but it does seem important.

In addition, before all assembly, these special bytes have to exist for CalibriJr:
```
43 61 4a 75 66 04
```

With those bytes, CalibriJr will consider your program a figure, and let you open it. When opening, it'll run whatever assembly code is defined, with no restrictions. That being said, it's not like running a regular program, and some extra steps are certainly needed for it to work. More research will be needed.
